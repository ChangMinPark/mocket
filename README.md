Unique Features
---
-	Unique testing system helping users to memorize words in lifetime.
-	Supports built in dictionary. Users can lookup words and directly add to memory list.
-	Keeps bothering users to finish daily test. (A duration can be configurable).
-	Supports a fun card game(words get picked randomly form memory list).

Lifetime memory
---

According to [Ebbinghaus's forget curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve), people get a stronger memory when they are able to recall it longer period of time.
So, Mocket gives tests in certain periods.

As shown on above picture, it gives tests everyday for first three days. After that, the period gets longer, and this helps users to memorize words for lifetime.
